# GoCricket

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.2.0.

## Why?

I made this for an Angular assessment to demo some ng 20 knowlege as well as to have a little bit of fun putting together an app that's less serious than what I usually do at work

## Anything new?

I think it'd be fun to add the ability to use sockets and make this a multiplayer game. Something where you could send a friend a unique url and they could play against you. Of course this would need to be hosted. So for now it's just a single player game.

## CPU Difficulty

The CPU players have different difficulty levels based on their name:

- Alice: Hard
- Bob: Medium
- Charlie: Easy

The difficulty level determines the percentage of optimal plays the CPU will make:

- Easy: 30% optimal plays
- Medium: 60% optimal plays
- Hard: 90% optimal plays

This "AI" is still a work in progress, I thought it'd be a fun idea to iterate in the future, but for now it's not as intelligent as it should be in the decisions (in any mode)
